this is an implementation of [liads ElectraClimate](https://gist.github.com/liads/c702fd4b8529991af9cd52d03b694814). with a few tweaks and fixes, and as a external component,
since custom components are now being [deprecated](https://esphome.io/guides/contributing#a-note-about-custom-components).
to install add to your yaml config:
```
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/omersht/ElectraEspHome
      ref: main
```
this is built over the original [IR Climate Remote](https://esphome.io/components/climate/climate_ir.html), with liads logic, and the tweaks requierd for an electra AC,
so yaml config is the exact same as the [IR Climate Remote](https://esphome.io/components/climate/climate_ir.html), just replace the

```
climate:
  - platform: SOMENAME
```
with:
```
climate:
  - platform: electra
```

to do list:
add reciving capabilities.
